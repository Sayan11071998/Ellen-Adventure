# ***🚀 Ellen Adventure 🚀***

Ellen Adventure is a 2D platformer developed in Unity, where players navigate through vibrant levels with precise controls and challenging AI enemies. Featuring smooth animations, a level progression system, and a heart-based player lives system, the game offers engaging platforming gameplay with a strategic twist.

### **Here’s what players are in for:**

- **🏃 Core Platforming Mechanics:** Built with RigidBody2D, because precision movement and perfect jump controls don’t make themselves. Testing? Let’s just say I jumped more times than Mario on a caffeine rush. ☕🕹️
- **🎵 Seamless Audio & Level Management:** Used the Singleton pattern to handle audio and transitions like a pro (or at least like a pro who’s watched a lot of Unity tutorials). Now the gameplay sounds as polished as it looks! 🔊🎶
- **🗺️ Level Design:** Used Unity TileMaps to piece together levels, one tile at a time, because who doesn’t love pixel-perfect adjustments? 🎨👾
- **🌟 Level Progression System:** PlayerPrefs and Enums made level progression easy-peasy. 🔓🚀
- **🎨 Rich Animations:** Brought Ellen and the enemies to life using Animator. Every jump, every dodge—it’s all there… even if the jump animation occasionally looks like a small leap of faith. 🤸🎬
- **🤖 Enemy AI Patrol:** Added AI patrols using Physics2D RayCast, so enemies don’t just stand around waiting for a hero to save the day. They’re on the move, which is both fun and terrifying. ⚔️🤖
- **❤️ Player Lives System:** Three lives, heart-based UI… because I thought making it too easy just wouldn’t be fun! Surviving till that last heart? Definitely heart-stopping. 💖🛡️
- **📋 Game UI:** Built Lobby, Level Selection, Game Over, and Main Menu using Unity UI and TextMeshPro. Tried to make it look clean and simple, with only a few accidental clicks that throw you out of the game. 🙄📱
- **🧲 Pickup Item System:** Created pickups using Collider2D’s IsTrigger property. Now Ellen can grab things mid-run like she’s shopping on Black Friday. 🎉✨

### **Key Takeaways 📚:**
- 🎮 Gained a solid foundation in RigidBody2D, TileMaps, and Physics2D (and a newfound respect for platformers in general). 
- 💡 Mastered the Singleton pattern for sanity’s sake, keeping my scripts from tripping over each other. 
- 🧩 Improved my C# skills to manage UI, animations, and player feedback in a (mostly) structured way.

And yes, Ellen Adventure may have a shaky jump animation that I’ll definitely refine (one day!) and Coroutines are my next quest for smoother transitions. But despite the long hours, all-nighters, and slightly jittery animations, I couldn’t be prouder of how this first project turned out!

Looking forward to sharing more (hopefully polished) Unity projects soon! 🌟👾
