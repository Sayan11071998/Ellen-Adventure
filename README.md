# ðŸš€ Ellen Adventure â€“ A 2D Platformer Journey ðŸš€

**Ellen Adventure** is a Unity-built 2D platformer where players guide Ellen through vibrant tile-based levels filled with enemies, pickups, and hazards. With responsive controls, polished UI, and animated characters, the game blends classic mechanics with modern design and a dose of personal humor.

## Game Features

- **Core Platforming Mechanics**  
  Developed responsive movement using Rigidbody2D physics. Jumping, running, and platform control feel tight and intentional (after many hours of playtesting and tweaking).

- **Seamless Audio & Level Management**  
  Implemented the Singleton pattern to handle background music and scene transitions smoothly across the game.

- **Level Design with TileMaps**  
  Created tile-based levels using Unityâ€™s TileMap system for precise design control and modularity.

- **Level Progression System**  
  Managed level unlocking and saving with Enums and PlayerPrefsâ€”simple, effective, and scalable.

- **Smooth Character Animations**  
  Built animations for movement, jumping, and damage using Animator. Even if Ellenâ€™s jump sometimes feels dramatic, itâ€™s all part of her charm.

- **Enemy AI Patrol System**  
  Designed basic enemy AI with patrol behaviors via Physics2D Raycastsâ€”adds a layer of timing and tension to each level.

- **Heart-Based Lives System**  
  Players start with three lives, displayed in a heart-based UI. Lose them all, and itâ€™s back to the last checkpointâ€”or the main menu.

- **Complete Game UI Suite**  
  Includes Main Menu, Level Select, Lobby, and Game Over screens. Built using Unity UI and TextMeshPro for clarity and consistency.

- **Pickup System**  
  Items like coins or power-ups are handled via `Collider2D` triggers, giving Ellen more to grab (and players more to chase).

## Key Takeaways

- **Unity Foundations**  
  Developed strong skills with Rigidbody2D, Physics2D, Animator, and TileMap systems.

- **Design Patterns**  
  Applied the Singleton pattern to manage audio and game flow more efficiently.

- **C# Development**  
  Sharpened C# scripting for managing animations, UI, lives, and pickups in a structured game loop.

- **UI/UX Awareness**  
  Learned the importance of clear menus and feedbackâ€”accidental game exits make for unhappy playtesters.

## Final Thoughts

Yes, Ellenâ€™s jump animation might still need a little polish (and coroutines are next on my list to master). But between enemy patrol logic, smooth transitions, level unlocking, and responsive gameplay, this game became a true learning milestone. I'm proud of how far Ellen Adventure has come and canâ€™t wait to build on this momentum with future projects.

Stay tuned for whatâ€™s next in my Unity dev journey!
